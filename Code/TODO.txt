TODO:

export port number across projects



PORTING NOTES
-------------

get_tree().set_network_peer()   ->   ??? custom_multiplayer.set_root_path("/GatewayServer")
custom_multiplayer.set_network_peer(network)   ->   custom_multiplayer.set_multiplayer_peer(network)


CHEATSHEET
----------
One off timers:    get_tree().create_timer(1.0).timeout.connect(YourFunction)


GRIPES
------

auto complete, would be nice to search only in bottom most class items

Searching editor settings i.e. "port", does not search across all sections!!!!!

in filesystem panel, add new scene, creates new scene but does not save immediately

Script editor:
  when you collapse the file list, should still show current file name, maybe on the collapse bar (currently just dead space)
  need better script file navigation, ie next file/ prev file
