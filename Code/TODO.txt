TODO:

- test dictionary looping for value in dict: ?? returns value??

- Send world state to new clients on login

- implement register

- implement actual database


- export port number across projects

- how to load test?

- loading scene progress bar?  ->  see: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/io/background_loading.html

- 2fa? sms? trust device from mac?


NOTES
-----
- Godot hard limit 4095 concurrent players per network (ccu)
- requests per second (rps) 
- x509 certificate cost 3rd party verification, cost estimate: ~ $25 / year
- NEVER let crypto key get on Client, only cert, Gateway gets both key and cert.
- password hashing: 
	slow: bcrypt, scrypt, lyra2, argon2  <-  not integrated in godot
	fast: sha, sha2

- which runs first, singleton or main scene?

QUESTIONS
---------
Does godot have something like Debug.Log that get removed at export time? functionally like commenting out dbg statements?


PORTING NOTES
-------------

get_tree().set_network_peer()   ->   ??? custom_multiplayer.set_root_path("/GatewayServer")
custom_multiplayer.set_network_peer(network)   ->   custom_multiplayer.set_multiplayer_peer(network)

int(string)?  <--  String.to_int()

get_tree().get_rpc_sender_id()  ->  multiplayer.get_remote_sender_id(

game_server.network.disconnect_peer(game_client_id)  ->  game_server.network.get_peer(game_client_id).peer_disconnect() 

custom_multiplayer  ->  get_tree().set_multiplayer(your_multiplayerapi, "/path/to/branch")
custom_multiplayer.poll() not really needed explicitly, now: get_tree().multiplayer_poll = true (which is default)


CHEATSHEET
----------
One off timers (4.0):    get_tree().create_timer(1.0).timeout.connect(YourFunction)


GRIPES
------
should be able to drag nodes to inspector for a different object, alpha 7 makes it go away on click on the node

see also current github issues around 4.0: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+milestone%3A4.0+label%3Abug+

auto complete, would be nice to search only in bottom most class items

Searching editor settings i.e. "port", does not search across all sections!!!!!

in filesystem panel, add new scene, creates new scene but does not save immediately

Script editor:
  when you collapse the file list, should still show current file name, maybe on the collapse bar (currently just dead space)
  need better script file navigation, ie next file/ prev file
